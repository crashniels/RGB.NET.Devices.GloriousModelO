A DeviceProvider for RGB.NET for the Glorious Model O. Probably only half the Project here since git is not uploading all the files for some reason. It worked fine for my DS4 repo. 
Usage: Replace driver for Interface 1 of the Mouse with the WinUSB driver. The /x86 path needs the ModelO dll from my ModelO repo and libusb.
